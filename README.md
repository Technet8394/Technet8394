# Hello

I am a cybersecurity student who spends a majority of my time programming just trying to do one specific thing that popped into my head, without a clue of how to even start.

I know Powershell and Python, but can use Bash, C++ and Javascript very poorly, in order from best to worst.

I mainly contribute in private repositories as most of my code is not ready to be public, or cannot be made public.

Feel free to dig into unmaintainable code, and my blog, which at least I can maintain.
